# Project Hermes
The resume landscape needs to change. While other players in this space focus on the social network piece of the resume/job market, *Project Hermes* focuses on verifying your employment, your skills, and other projects and credentials. No more ads, no more marketings emails from people you don't know. This is your digital space to share your professional experience with peers, coworkers, and truly network.
